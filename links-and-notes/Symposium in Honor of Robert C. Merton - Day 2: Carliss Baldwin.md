> Created a set of definitions and Stuart's has been using them and we've seen them the last whole day, that separated the first order essential properties from the second order distractions. 
> Basically took a lot of the world's complexity away from the analysis and given clear definitions you can apply logic and sometimes mathmatical tools and derive result that can be tracked back to primitive assumptions.

> Technology are highly divisible, so that finding the very unit of analysis is a challenge. Their motion is not observable at scale, it happens in hidding. 
> As it were, you only see the end results.
> The outcomes are uncertain, but probability distributions are not available through any mechanism that we know.
> And the inputs combined in non-linear ways. We're used to non-linearity from option theory, but we are not always so sure how it works.
> Part of what I'm going talk to you about is how I believe it works.


[3:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0Oh-0AZ7Vo&t=212s) How do we talk about technology?

> Two level of technical analysis
> - Down in  the Weeds
>     - Look at engineering requirements
>     - Each engineering discipline has its own language system, no way to cross the borders
> - Big categories
>     - Incremental --- Radical
>     - Incumbent --- Disruptive
>     - Narrow prupose --- General Purpose
>     - Physical --- Digital

> Neither approach helps us to predict when and why different forms of organization succeed ... or fail.

> But I want to say, building on Steward's presentation. If you want to really boggle your imagination. I'm going to argue that there are real options embedded in the very productive systems the actual production processes and organizational structures chosen by the firms. 
> So how do those options which are numerous and in every company both mature and growth. How would you incorporate those options into an integrated theory of capital structure. That would be quite something.

> Arguements:
> - Organizations succeed(thus survive) by implementing technologies better than rivals.
