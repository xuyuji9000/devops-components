> Created a set of definitions and Stuart's has been using them and we've seen them the last whole day, that separated the first order essential properties from the second order distractions. 
> Basically took a lot of the world's complexity away from the analysis and given clear definitions you can apply logic and sometimes mathmatical tools and derive result that can be tracked back to primitive assumptions.

> Technology are highly divisible, so that finding the very unit of analysis is a challenge. Their motion is not observable at scale, it happens in hidding. 
> As it were, you only see the end results.
> The outcomes are uncertain, but probability distributions are not available through any mechanism that we know.
> And the inputs combined in non-linear ways. We're used to non-linearity from option theory, but we are not always so sure how it works.
> Part of what I'm going talk to you about is how I believe it works.


[3:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0Oh-0AZ7Vo&t=212s) How do we talk about technology?

> Two level of technical analysis
> - Down in  the Weeds
>     - Look at engineering requirements
>     - Each engineering discipline has its own language system, no way to cross the borders
> - Big categories
>     - Incremental --- Radical
>     - Incumbent --- Disruptive
>     - Narrow prupose --- General Purpose
>     - Physical --- Digital

> Neither approach helps us to predict when and why different forms of organization succeed ... or fail.

> But I want to say, building on Steward's presentation. If you want to really boggle your imagination. I'm going to argue that there are real options embedded in the very productive systems the actual production processes and organizational structures chosen by the firms. 
> So how do those options which are numerous and in every company both mature and growth. How would you incorporate those options into an integrated theory of capital structure. That would be quite something.

> We cannot in fact explain or predict the history of our economy from 1917 when Chandler's big firms were dominant to 2017 when a whole new set of firms at vastly larger market values.
>
> Why are we seeing this transition? Why do the market values sort out the way they do?
>
> So I'm gonna try to give an explanation based on the theory of real options.

> Arguements:
> - Organizations succeed(thus survive) by implementing technologies better than rivals.
>     > That's functional arguement. The function of the organization is to carry out a technology in some fashion that generates value.
> - There are two fundamental types of technologies: *step processes* and *platform systems*
> - They demand "almost opposite" forms  of organization

[6:45](https://youtu.be/e0Oh-0AZ7Vo?t=405) Two foundamental types of technology

> - Step processes 
> - Platform systems

[7:20](https://youtu.be/e0Oh-0AZ7Vo?t=440) Operations, distribution, marketing rely on step processes

[8:33](https://youtu.be/e0Oh-0AZ7Vo?t=513) Four types of platform systems

[10:45](https://youtu.be/e0Oh-0AZ7Vo?t=645) Same firm may contain many different types of platforms

[11:35](https://youtu.be/e0Oh-0AZ7Vo?t=695) Step processes


[13:33](https://youtu.be/e0Oh-0AZ7Vo?t=813) Real option intuition

> This chunk needs a better knowledge of option theory to understand.

> Using techniques out of [Theory of Rational Option Pricing](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL4784786W/Theory_of_rational_option_pricing?edition=theoryofrational00mert)

[15:45](https://youtu.be/e0Oh-0AZ7Vo?t=945) Piecemeal control cannot address system wide bottlenecks

[16:10](https://youtu.be/e0Oh-0AZ7Vo?t=970) Implications for organization

[17:01](https://youtu.be/e0Oh-0AZ7Vo?t=1021) What about platform systems?

[17:23](https://youtu.be/e0Oh-0AZ7Vo?t=1045) What do the four types of platform have in common?

[18:11](https://youtu.be/e0Oh-0AZ7Vo?t=1091) Platform system vs Step Process Value structure

[18:53](https://youtu.be/e0Oh-0AZ7Vo?t=1133) Provable properties of platform systems

[19:47](https://youtu.be/e0Oh-0AZ7Vo?t=1189) Implications or organization

[20:40](https://youtu.be/e0Oh-0AZ7Vo?t=1240) In terms of organization design, platform systems are the opposite of step processes

[21:12](https://youtu.be/e0Oh-0AZ7Vo?t=1272) But steps and platforms are not really opposites

[21:57](https://youtu.be/e0Oh-0AZ7Vo?t=1319) The real question is: How many modules, why and where?

[22:40](https://youtu.be/e0Oh-0AZ7Vo?t=1360) Modules are more valuable when underlying technologies are changing rapidly

[23:26](https://youtu.be/e0Oh-0AZ7Vo?t=1406) Rates of technical change are MUCH higher for computers and software than for physical goods.

[24:48](https://youtu.be/e0Oh-0AZ7Vo?t=1488) Value of system as a function of number of modules and the rate of technical change

[28:01](https://youtu.be/e0Oh-0AZ7Vo?t=1681) This means
