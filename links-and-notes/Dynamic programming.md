[Dynamic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming)

Dynamic programming is both a programming optimization method and a computer programming method.

The method was developed by Richard Bellman in the 1950s and has found applications in numerous fields, from aerospace engineering to economics.

In both contexts it refers to simplifying a complicated problem by breaking it down into simpler sub-programs in a recursive manner. While some decisions that span several points in time do often break apart recursively. Likewise, in computer science, if a problem can be solved optimally by breaking it into sub-problems and then recursively finding the optimal solutions to the sub-problems, then it is said to have optimal substructure.

If a sub-problems can be nested recursively inside larger problems, so that dynamic programming method are applicable, then there is a relation between the value of the larger problem and the values of the sub-problems. In the optimization literature this relationship is called the Bellman equation.
