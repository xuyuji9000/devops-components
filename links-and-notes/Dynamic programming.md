[Dynamic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming)

Dynamic programming is both a programming optimization method and a computer programming method.

The method was developed by Richard Bellman in the 1950s and has found applications in numerous fields, from aerospace engineering to economics.

In both contexts it refers to simplifying a complicated problem by breaking it down into simpler sub-programs in a recursive manner.
