[5.7.1 How the MAKE Variable Works](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/MAKE-Variable.html)


Recursive make commands should always use the variable MAKE, not the explicit command name 'make'

the value of the variable is the file name with which make was invoked. If this file name was /bin/make, then the recipe executed is "cd subdir && /bin/make". If you use a special version of make to run the top-level makefile, the same special version will be executed for recursive invocations.
