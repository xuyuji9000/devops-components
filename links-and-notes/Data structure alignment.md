The CPU in modern computer hardware performs reads and writes to memory most efficiently when the data is naturally aligned.


Data alignment:

    Data alignment means putting the data in memory at address equal to some multiple of the word size. This increases the performance of system due to the way the CPU handles memory.

Data structure padding:

   Now, to align the data, it may be necessary to insert some extra bytes between the end of the last data structure and the start of the next data structure as the data is placed in memory as multiples of fixed word size.
