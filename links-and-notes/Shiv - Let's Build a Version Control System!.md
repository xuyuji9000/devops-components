This document is used to record the notes of reading the article[1].

- Environment: `busybox:stable`

    `docker run -it busybox:stable`

    > Cause I'm using Macos which uses BSD userland, so I'm using docker to get a busybox userland for having an environment aligned with the article.

- `(>&2 echo 'Already a shiv repository.')` looks like a nice way to put out warning information into the sterr.

- Use internals

    ``` bash
    #!/bin/sh

    set -ex

    shiv_bin="$(realpath "$0")"

    # Init a new repository
    if [ "$1" = '_init' ]; then
        if [ -d '.shiv' ]; then
            (>&2 echo 'Already a shiv repository.')
            exit 1
        fi

        mkdir '.shiv'

        # TODO: Form a tree of folders...

        exit 0
    fi

    # CLI parsing
    if [ "$1" = 'init' ]; then
        "$shiv_bin" '_init'
        exit 0
    else
        (>&2 echo 'Unknown command.')
        exit 1
    fi

    ```

    > `init` is by design exposed to user, `_init` is a service to `init`

    > It's interesting the whole script is organized around getting `shiv_bin` and pass parameter into it.

- Find **.shiv** directory

    ``` bash
    # Find the shiv repository
    if [ "$1" = '_find_shiv' ]; then
        # Search upward to sysroot.
        dir="$(pwd)"
        while [ ! -d "$dir"/.shiv ] && [ "$dir" != '/' ]; do
            dir="$(dirname "$dir")"
        done

        # If we found something, emit it.
        if [ -d "$dir"/.shiv ]; then
            echo "$dir"
            exit 0
        else
            exit 1
        fi
    fi
    ```

    > This logic is reused many many times.

- if condition based on script exit code


    ``` bash
    # Init a new repository
    if [ "$1" = '_init' ]; then
        if "$shiv_bin" '_find_shiv' >/dev/null; then
            (>&2 echo 'Already a shiv repository.')
            exit 1
        fi

        mkdir '.shiv'

        # TODO: Form a tree of folders...

        exit 0
    fi
    ```

- Dissect `relpath()`

    ``` bash
    relPath () {
        local common path up
        common=${1%/} path=${2%/}
        while test "${path#"$common"/}" = "$path"; do
            common=${common%/*} up=../$up
        done
        path=$up${path#"$common"/}; path=${path%/}; printf %s "${path:-.}"
    }
    # Readlink requires the file actually exist with the -f flag, but we don't
    # have much of a choice.
    relpath () { relPath "$(readlink -f "$1")" "$(readlink -f "$2")"; }
    ```

    > `readlink -f` follow through the symbolic link and return absolute path

    > `${parameter%word}` remove the shortest suffix matching pattern[2]

    > `common=${1%/}` remove **/** from the end of `$1`

    > `${parameter#word}` remove the shortest prefix matching pattern

    > It feels weired **..** is used in the relative path from file to repo root, cause this means target file is outside of the repo root
