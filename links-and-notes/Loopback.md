[Loopback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loopback)

Loopback is the routing of electronic signals or digital data streams back to their source without intentional processing or modification. It is primarily a means of testing the communication infrastructure.

In telecommunications, loopback devices perform transmission tests of access lines from the serving switching center, which usually does not require the assistance of personnel at the served terminal.
